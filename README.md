# Encoding and Obfuscation Techniques

## Overview
This project explores basic encoding and obfuscation techniques commonly observed
in malware and offensive tooling, with the goal of improving defensive detection
and analysis skills.

## Objective
- Study how encoding techniques transform payloads
- Understand why signature-based detection can fail
- Improve blue-team and malware analysis capabilities

## Techniques Covered
- Base64 encoding
- ROT13 substitution cipher
- XOR encoding with symmetric key

## Scope
- Educational research only
- No exploitation or delivery mechanisms
- No real-world attack usage

## Ethical Notice
This repository is strictly for educational and defensive cybersecurity research.
The techniques demonstrated here must not be used for malicious purposes.
